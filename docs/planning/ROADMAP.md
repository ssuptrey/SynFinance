## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Performance degradation with scale  
**Mitigation:** Week 7 dedicated to optimization, benchmark suite established  
**Contingency:** Use distributed generation (Dask/Ray) if needed

**Risk:** Fraud patterns not realistic enough  
**Mitigation:** Domain expert review in Week 4-5, iterative refinement  
**Contingency:** Collaborate with financial fraud experts, use real pattern studies

**Risk:** State tracking memory issues with millions of customers  
**Mitigation:** Implement LRU cache, periodic state cleanup  
**Contingency:** Move to Redis/database for state management

### Schedule Risks

**Risk:** Feature creep in Weeks 9-10 (API/Web UI)  
**Mitigation:** MVP approach, defer advanced features to post-launch  
**Contingency:** Cut web UI to basic Streamlit, focus on API

**Risk:** Week 12 testing reveals critical bugs  
**Mitigation:** Continuous testing throughout, catch issues early  
**Contingency:** Add Week 13 buffer for critical fixes
