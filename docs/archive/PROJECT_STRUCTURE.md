1. **Start with README.md** for project overview
2. **Use docs/INDEX.md** as documentation hub
3. **Check RECOVERY_STATUS.md** for current recovery status
4. **Refer to docs/planning/ROADMAP.md** for development plan
5. **Use this file (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)** to understand organization

## Maintenance Notes

- All Python source files are intact and working
- Documentation was recovered after corruption incident (Oct 16, 2025)
- All emojis removed for professional appearance
- Version 1.0.0 - Foundation phase

## Modular Refactoring (October 17, 2025)

### Why Refactor?

The original `data_generator.py` was **889 lines** and growing. With 11 more weeks of features to add (Weeks 2-12), it would have reached **3,000-5,000+ lines** by Week 6, making it:
- Hard to maintain
- Difficult to test
- Prone to bugs
- Impossible to work on in parallel

### What Changed?

**Before:** Monolithic file (889 lines)
```
data_generator.py (889 lines)
  ├─ INDIAN_FESTIVALS
  ├─ INDIAN_MERCHANTS (100+ merchants)
  ├─ UPI_HANDLES
  ├─ TransactionGenerator class
  └─ Legacy methods
```

**After:** Modular architecture (950 lines across 3 files)
```
data_generator.py (235 lines)         # Clean API
generators/transaction_core.py (608)  # Core logic
utils/indian_data.py (107)           # Market data
```

### Benefits Achieved

✅ **73% reduction** in main file size (889 → 235 lines)  
✅ **Clean separation** of concerns (data vs logic vs API)  
✅ **Easy to extend** (just add new modules for Week 2+)  
✅ **Better testing** (can test modules independently)  
✅ **Backward compatible** (existing code still works)  
✅ **Performance improved** (17,858 → 25,739 txn/sec)  
✅ **All tests passing** (19/19 - 100%)

### For Developers

**Old imports still work:**
```python
from data_generator import TransactionGenerator, generate_realistic_dataset
```

**New modular imports also work:**
```python
from generators.transaction_core import TransactionGenerator
from utils.indian_data import INDIAN_MERCHANTS, INDIAN_FESTIVALS
```
