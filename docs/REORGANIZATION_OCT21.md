# Documentation Reorganization Complete

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Version:** 0.4.0  
**Status:** COMPLETE

## Summary

The SynFinance documentation has been reorganized for better scalability and maintainability. All documents are now organized into logical folders by week and topic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Progress Folder Reorganization

**Created Week-Based Subfolders:**
```
docs/progress/
├── week1/    # Week 1: Customer Profile System
├── week2/    # Week 2: Temporal, Geographic & Merchant Patterns
├── week3/    # Week 3: Advanced Schema & Variance Analysis
└── week4/    # Week 4: Fraud Pattern Library
```

**Files Moved:**
- All WEEK1_*.md files moved to progress/week1/
- All WEEK2_*.md files moved to progress/week2/
- All WEEK3_*.md files moved to progress/week3/
- All WEEK4_*.md files moved to progress/week4/

### 2. Technical Folder Reorganization

**Created Topic-Based Subfolders:**
```
docs/technical/
├── fraud/     # Fraud pattern documentation
└── schemas/   # Data schema documentation
```

**Files Moved:**
- FRAUD_PATTERNS.md → technical/fraud/FRAUD_PATTERNS.md
- FIELD_REFERENCE.md → technical/schemas/FIELD_REFERENCE.md
- CUSTOMER_SCHEMA.md → technical/schemas/CUSTOMER_SCHEMA.md

### 3. Navigation Files Created

**New Index Files:**
- docs/progress/INDEX.md - Weekly progress navigation
- docs/technical/INDEX.md - Technical documentation navigation
- docs/STRUCTURE.md - Quick structure overview

**Updated Files:**
- docs/INDEX.md - Updated to reflect new structure
- docs/ORGANIZATION.md - Updated header (historical reference)

## Benefits

1. **Scalability** - Easy to add new weeks (week5/, week6/, etc.)
2. **Organization** - Related documents grouped together
3. **Navigation** - Index files provide clear navigation
4. **Maintainability** - Easier to find and update documents
5. **Professional** - Industry-standard folder organization

## File Counts

- **Progress Files:** 20+ files organized into 4 week folders
- **Technical Files:** 10+ files with 2 topic subfolders
- **Index Files:** 3 new navigation files created
- **Total Documentation:** 340+ KB across 50+ files

## Navigation Quick Reference

| Category | Location | Index File |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Weekly Progress | docs/progress/week[1-4]/ | progress/INDEX.md |
| Fraud Patterns | docs/technical/fraud/ | technical/INDEX.md |
| Data Schemas | docs/technical/schemas/ | technical/INDEX.md |
| User Guides | docs/guides/ | INDEX.md |
| Planning | docs/planning/ | INDEX.md |

## Next Steps

1. Continue adding Week 4 progress to progress/week4/
2. Add new fraud pattern docs to technical/fraud/ as needed
3. Add schema updates to technical/schemas/
4. Keep index files updated with new documents

## Commands Used

```bash
# Create week folders
mkdir docs\progress\week1 week2 week3 week4

# Create technical subfolders
mkdir docs\technical\fraud schemas

# Move files
move docs\progress\WEEK1_*.md docs\progress\week1\
move docs\progress\WEEK2_*.md docs\progress\week2\
move docs\progress\WEEK3_*.md docs\progress\week3\
move docs\progress\WEEK4_*.md docs\progress\week4\

move docs\technical\FRAUD_PATTERNS.md docs\technical\fraud\
move docs\technical\FIELD_REFERENCE.md docs\technical\schemas\
move docs\technical\CUSTOMER_SCHEMA.md docs\technical\schemas\
```

## Verification

All files successfully moved and organized:
- Week folders: 4 created (week1-4)
- Technical subfolders: 2 created (fraud, schemas)
- Index files: 3 created
- No files lost in reorganization
