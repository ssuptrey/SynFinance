### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dataclass Structure**:
   - Used Python dataclass for type safety and clarity
   - Organized features into logical categories with comments
   - Included both IDs and labels for traceability

2. **Interaction Features**:
   - Implemented as separate calculator class for modularity
   - Each feature has dedicated calculation method
   - Non-linear combinations capture complex patterns

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Optimized for processing multiple transactions at once
   - Maintains consistency across feature generation
   - Efficient statistics calculation

4. **Feature Weights**:
   - Configurable weights in weighted_risk_score
   - Based on feature category importance:
     - Fraud velocity: 30%
     - Fraud geographic: 25%
     - Fraud behavioral: 20%
     - Anomaly severity: 15%
     - Anomaly frequency: 10%

## Integration Points

### ML Model Training
```python
# Extract features for sklearn
X = [f.get_feature_values() for f in combined_features]  # 68 features
y = [f.is_fraud for f in combined_features]  # Labels

# Train model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X, y)
```

### Feature Selection
```python
# Get feature names
feature_names = combined_features[0].get_feature_names()

# Train model and get importance
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
importances = clf.feature_importances_

# Identify top features
top_features = sorted(zip(feature_names, importances), 
                      key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:20]
```

### High-Risk Detection
```python
# Use ensemble probability for alerting
high_risk = [f for f in combined_features 
             if f.ensemble_fraud_probability > 0.7]

# Check for conflicts (potential false positives)
conflicts = [f for f in high_risk if f.conflict_indicator == 1]
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Generation Speed
- **500 transactions**: ~5-10 seconds
- **5,000 transactions**: ~60-90 seconds
- **50,000 transactions**: ~10-15 minutes

### Memory Usage
- **500 transactions**: ~10 MB
- **5,000 transactions**: ~100 MB
- **50,000 transactions**: ~1 GB

### Optimization Opportunities
- Batch processing already implemented
- Customer history caching reduces repeated lookups
- Statistics calculated in single pass over data

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Production Fraud Detection
- Use all 68 features for maximum accuracy
- ensemble_fraud_probability provides ready-to-use risk score
- Supports real-time and batch scoring

### 2. Model Development
- Compare performance across feature subsets:
  - Fraud-only (32 features)
  - Anomaly-only (26 features)
  - Combined (68 features)
- Identify most important features

### 3. Alert Prioritization
- Use weighted_risk_score for queue ranking
- conflict_indicator helps reduce false positives
- Multiple risk signals for confidence scoring

### 4. Feature Engineering Research
- Interaction features demonstrate non-linear patterns
- Extensible calculator for adding new interactions
- Statistics help identify signal vs. noise

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Modular Design** - Separate calculator for interactions makes testing easy
2. **Batch Processing** - Significant performance gains over single-transaction
3. **Type Safety** - Dataclass catches errors early
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - 26 tests ensure reliability

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Feature Count Accuracy** - Initial count was 69, corrected to 68 (26 anomaly, not 27)
2. **Type Compatibility** - Required asdict() for anomaly features, to_dict() for fraud features
3. **SimpleNamespace Conversion** - vars() needed to convert to dict for ML engineer

### Best Practices Established
1. Always validate feature counts against implementation
2. Use consistent to_dict/asdict patterns
3. Document all feature categories clearly
4. Include feature statistics in examples

- Anomaly features use asdict(), fraud features use to_dict()
- SimpleNamespace requires vars() conversion before ML engineer
- All tests must pass before merging

### For Data Scientists
- ensemble_fraud_probability is recommended starting point
- Top features by variance may indicate importance
- Interaction features often have high predictive power
- conflict_indicator useful for model debugging

### For DevOps
- Example script takes ~10 seconds for 500 transactions
- Output directory auto-created
- All dependencies in requirements.txt
- No external services required
