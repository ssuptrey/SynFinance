### 2. AdvancedSchemaGenerator Implementation

**File:** `src/generators/advanced_schema_generator.py` (431 lines)

**Key Methods:**

#### `generate_card_type(payment_mode: str, digital_savviness: str) -> str`
- Returns "Credit", "Debit", or "NA" based on payment mode
- UPI/Cash → "NA"
- Card payments weighted by digital savviness:
  - HIGH: 70% Credit, 30% Debit
  - MEDIUM: 40% Credit, 60% Debit
  - LOW: 20% Credit, 80% Debit

#### `generate_transaction_status(customer_segment: str, amount: float) -> str`
- Returns "Approved" (97-99%), "Declined" (1-2%), "Pending" (0.5-1%)
- Higher decline rates for:
  - Students (2%)
  - Large amounts (>₹50,000)
- Premium segments have lower decline rates

#### `generate_transaction_channel(payment_mode: str, is_online: bool, age: int) -> str`
- Returns "POS", "Online", "ATM", "Mobile"
- Logic:
  - UPI → 90% Mobile, 10% Online
  - Online payments → 100% Online
  - Card payments → POS/ATM mix
  - Younger customers prefer Mobile (80%+ for age <35)

#### `get_state_and_region(city: str) -> Tuple[str, str]`
- Maps 20 cities to Indian states
- Maps states to regions (North/South/East/West/Central)
- Returns: ("Maharashtra", "West") for Mumbai
- Comprehensive mapping for all major cities

#### `generate_customer_age_group(age: int) -> str`
- Returns age group: "18-25", "26-35", "36-45", "46-55", "56-65", "66+"
- Used for demographic analysis

#### `generate_device_info(payment_mode: str, channel: str, age: int, digital_savviness: str) -> Dict`
- Returns device_type, app_version, browser_type, os
- Realistic distributions:
  - Android: 72% (dominant in India)
  - iOS: 6% (premium)
  - Windows: 15% (web)
  - Chrome: 65% browser share
- App versions: "5.2.1", "5.1.9", etc. (realistic versioning)

#### `calculate_risk_indicators(...) -> Dict`
**CRITICAL FOR FRAUD DETECTION**

Calculates 5 risk indicators:

1. **distance_from_home** - Geographic anomaly
   - Calculates km between home_city and transaction city
   - Mumbai-Delhi = 1,400 km (high risk)
   - Mumbai-Pune = 150 km (moderate)
   - Same city = 0 km (normal)

2. **time_since_last_txn** - Velocity anomaly
   - Tracks minutes since customer's last transaction
   - <5 minutes = suspicious (possible card cloning)
   - Normal: 60-120 minutes between transactions
   - Uses state dictionary: customer_last_txn

3. **is_first_transaction_with_merchant** - Novelty risk
   - Boolean flag for new merchant
   - TRUE for first time = moderate risk
   - Tracks via state: customer_merchants dict

4. **daily_transaction_count** - Velocity tracking
   - Running count of transactions today
   - >10 transactions = high risk
   - Tracks via state: daily_txn_counts dict
   - Resets daily

5. **daily_transaction_amount** - Spending velocity
   - Running total of spending today
   - >₹50,000 = high risk
   - >₹20,000 = moderate risk
   - Tracks via state: daily_txn_amounts dict

**State Management:**
- Uses 4 dictionaries to track customer history
- Enables realistic risk calculation
- Maintains state across transaction generation

---

### 3. State Tracking System

**Purpose:** Enable realistic risk indicators by tracking customer behavior

**State Dictionaries:**

```python
self.customer_last_txn = {}  # customer_id → timestamp
self.daily_txn_counts = {}   # customer_id → count
self.daily_txn_amounts = {}  # customer_id → amount
self.customer_merchants = {} # customer_id → set(merchant_ids)
```

**Usage:**
- Tracks last transaction time for velocity analysis
- Counts daily transactions for fraud detection
- Sums daily spending for limit checks
- Remembers merchant relationships for novelty detection

**Resets:**
- Daily counts reset at midnight
- Merchant history persists across days
- Last transaction updates continuously

---

### 4. Backward Compatibility

**Method:** `Transaction.to_legacy_dict()`

- Converts lowercase dataclass fields → uppercase Week 1-2 format
- Maps: `transaction_id` → `Transaction_ID`
- Maps: `merchant_name` → `Merchant`
- Maintains compatibility with existing tests
- Enables gradual migration

**Benefit:** All Week 1-2 code continues to work without modification

---

### 5. Risk Score Calculation

**Method:** `Transaction.calculate_risk_score() -> float`

Returns risk score 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high) based on:

- **Distance Risk**
  - >500 km → +0.2
  - >200 km → +0.1

- **Velocity Risk**
  - <5 min since last → +0.2

- **New Merchant Risk**
  - First transaction → +0.1

- **Transaction Count Risk**
  - >10 today → +0.2
  - >5 today → +0.1

- **Amount Risk**
  - >₹50,000 today → +0.2
  - >₹20,000 today → +0.1

**Example:**
- Customer in Mumbai buys from Delhi merchant (>500km)
- 3 minutes after last transaction
- New merchant
- 8th transaction today
- ₹25,000 spent today
- **Risk Score:** 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 = **0.7 (HIGH RISK)**

## Integration Points

### With Week 1-2 Code

1. **TransactionGenerator** uses AdvancedSchemaGenerator
   - Calls `generate_all_advanced_fields()` for each transaction
   - Passes state dictionaries for risk tracking
   - Maintains backward compatibility

2. **Customer profiles** provide context
   - Age → age_group, Age Group → income_bracket
   - Digital Savviness → device preferences
   - Segment → transaction status probabilities

3. **Geographic data** feeds location fields
   - City → State → Region mapping
   - Distance calculations for risk
   - Location type determination

4. **Merchant data** enables risk indicators
   - Merchant ID → novelty detection
   - Merchant type → channel preferences
   - Reputation → transaction status

---

## Next Steps (Week 3 Days 2-3)

### Testing & Validation
1. Create `tests/generators/test_advanced_schema.py`
   - 15+ tests for Transaction dataclass methods
   - 10+ tests for AdvancedSchemaGenerator methods
   - Validate risk indicator calculations
   - Test state tracking system

### Correlation Analysis
2. Generate large dataset (10K+ transactions)
3. Calculate correlations between all 43 fields
4. Identify meaningful relationships:
   - Age vs. Payment Mode
   - Income vs. Transaction Amount
   - Digital Savviness vs. Device Type
   - Distance vs. Risk Score
   - Time of Day vs. Channel

### Documentation Updates
5. Update INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md with 43-field schema
6. Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md with new API methods
7. Create field reference table for all 43 fields
8. Document nullable fields and default values

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **State tracking** enables realistic risk indicators
2. **Backward compatibility** via to_legacy_dict() prevents breaking changes
3. **Comprehensive docstrings** make code self-documenting
4. **Type hints** catch errors early

### Challenges Overcome
1. Managing 4 state dictionaries across transactions
2. Realistic decline rate calibration (1-2% vs. real-world)
3. Indian market device distribution research
4. Distance calculation between all city pairs

### Technical Decisions
1. Used dataclass for clean field definition
2. Separate generator class for advanced fields
3. State dictionaries over database for performance
4. Risk score calculation as instance method
