**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Test Results:** 21/21 tests passing (100%)

## Objective

Implement a realistic merchant ecosystem for synthetic transactions:
- Unique merchant IDs
- Chain vs local merchant distinction
- City-specific merchant pools
- Merchant reputation scores
- Customer-merchant loyalty tracking

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. MerchantGenerator Class
- Creates merchant pools by city/tier
- Chain merchants available across multiple cities
- Local merchants specific to each city
- Merchant reputation scores (0.4-1.0)
- Customer favorites and loyalty tracking

### 2. Merchant Data Structures
- 20 cities, 3 tiers
- 12 merchant categories, 40+ subcategories
- Chain merchant details (regions, tiers, reputation)
- Local merchant name generation

### 3. Merchant Selection Logic
- Loyalty: 60-80% chance to revisit favorite merchant
- Chain merchants preferred for online transactions
- Reputation-weighted selection for new merchants
- 3-5 favorites tracked per customer/category

### 4. Example
```python
merchant_gen = MerchantGenerator(seed=42)
merchant = merchant_gen.select_merchant(customer, category, city)
# Returns Merchant object with ID, name, category, city, type, reputation
```

- All tests passing

---

## Key Achievements
