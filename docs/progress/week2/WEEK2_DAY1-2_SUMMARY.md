## Objective

Implement realistic temporal patterns for Indian financial transactions:
- Hour-of-day distributions
- Day-of-week and weekend effects
- Salary day and festival spending spikes

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. TemporalPatternGenerator Class
- Models hour-of-day, day-of-week, salary/festival effects
- Occupation-based hour distributions
- Segment-based weekday/weekend multipliers
- Salary day and pre-salary day logic
- Festival multipliers (Diwali, Holi, Eid, Christmas)

### 2. Key Features
- Hour selection based on occupation and day type
- Weekend spending boosts for young professionals, students, tech-savvy
- Salary day spikes (1st, 30th, month-end)
- Festival spending multipliers by segment
- Combined temporal multiplier for each transaction

### 3. Example Patterns
- Salaried employees: peaks at 8am, 1pm, 7pm weekdays
- Students: evening peak, weekend boost
- Family oriented: steady weekday, weekend shopping
- Affluent shoppers: high spending anytime, festival boost

### 4. Integration
- Used by TransactionGenerator for realistic time assignment
- Multiplies base transaction amount by temporal multiplier

---

## Example
```python
customer = CustomerProfile(...)
date = datetime(2025, 10, 1)  # Salary day
hour = temporal_gen.select_transaction_hour(customer, date)
multiplier, breakdown = temporal_gen.get_combined_temporal_multiplier(customer, date, festivals)
final_amount = base_amount * multiplier
```

---

## Test Coverage
- 18 tests for hour selection, day-of-week, salary/festival effects, integration

---

## Key Achievements
- Realistic time-based transaction patterns
