# Week 2, Days 3-4: Geographic Patterns Implementation - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Test Results:** 15/15 tests passing (100%)  
**Code Added:** 428 lines across 2 files

## Objective

Implement realistic geographic patterns for Indian transactions with:
- 80/15/5 city distribution (home/nearby/distant)
- Cost-of-living adjustments by city tier
- City-tier classification (metros, major cities, smaller cities)
- Merchant density patterns based on city infrastructure

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. GeographicPatternGenerator Class

**File:** `src/generators/geographic_generator.py` (428 lines)

**Core Features:**

#### City Tier Classification
```python
CITY_TIERS = {
    # Tier 1: Metros (8 cities)
    "Mumbai", "Delhi", "Bangalore", "Hyderabad",
    "Chennai", "Kolkata", "Pune", "Ahmedabad"
    
    # Tier 2: Major cities (7 cities)
    "Jaipur", "Lucknow", "Surat", "Chandigarh",
    "Indore", "Kochi", "Nagpur"
    
    # Tier 3: Smaller cities (5 cities)
    "Bhopal", "Visakhapatnam", "Patna",
    "Vadodara", "Coimbatore"
}
```

**Tier Characteristics:**
- **Tier 1 (Metros):** Population 5M+, complete infrastructure, all merchants available
- **Tier 2 (Major):** Population 1-5M, good infrastructure, 80% merchants available
- **Tier 3 (Smaller):** Population <1M, developing infrastructure, 60% merchants available

#### Cost-of-Living Multipliers

Applied to transaction amounts to reflect local purchasing power:

| City Tier | Multiplier | Impact | Example |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------|
| Tier 1 (Metro) | 1.3x | 30% higher prices | ₹1,000 → ₹1,300 |
| Tier 2 (Major) | 1.0x | Baseline prices | ₹1,000 → ₹1,000 |
| Tier 3 (Smaller) | 0.8x | 20% lower prices | ₹1,000 → ₹800 |

**Rationale:**
- Mumbai/Delhi have 30% higher living costs than Indore/Jaipur
- Smaller cities like Patna have 20% lower costs
- Reflects real-world economic differences across Indian cities

#### 80/15/5 Distribution Rule

**Transaction Location Pattern:**
- **80% Home City:** Customer's registered city
- **15% Nearby Cities:** Same region or proximity group
- **5% Travel/Distant:** Different region (travel scenario)

**Implementation:**
```python
def select_transaction_city(customer: CustomerProfile) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    rand = random.random()
    
    if rand < 0.80:
        return (customer.city, "home")
    elif rand < 0.95:
        nearby = get_nearby_cities(customer.city, customer)
        return (random.choice(nearby), "nearby")
    else:
        distant = get_distant_cities(customer.city, customer)
        return (random.choice(distant), "travel")
```

#### Proximity Groups

Cities grouped by geographical proximity and travel patterns:

```python
PROXIMITY_GROUPS = {
    # Maharashtra cluster
    "Mumbai": ["Pune", "Nagpur", "Surat", "Vadodara"],
    "Pune": ["Mumbai", "Surat", "Nagpur"],
    
    # North cluster (NCR + nearby)
    "Delhi": ["Chandigarh", "Jaipur", "Lucknow"],
    "Chandigarh": ["Delhi", "Jaipur", "Lucknow"],
    
    # South cluster
    "Bangalore": ["Chennai", "Hyderabad", "Kochi", "Coimbatore"],
    "Chennai": ["Bangalore", "Hyderabad", "Coimbatore"],
    "Hyderabad": ["Bangalore", "Chennai", "Visakhapatnam"],
    
    # East cluster
    "Kolkata": ["Patna", "Bhopal", "Visakhapatnam"],
    
    # West cluster
    "Ahmedabad": ["Surat", "Vadodara", "Mumbai", "Jaipur"],
    
    # Central cluster
    "Indore": ["Bhopal", "Nagpur", "Ahmedabad"],
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Based on actual geographic proximity (200-500 km)
- Common travel routes (highways, rail connections)
- Regional economic ties and migration patterns

#### Merchant Availability by Tier

```python
MERCHANT_DENSITY = {
    1: 1.0,   # Tier 1: 100% availability
    2: 0.8,   # Tier 2: 80% availability
    3: 0.6    # Tier 3: 60% availability
}
```

**Chain vs Local Merchants:**
- **Chain merchants** (Big Bazaar, Reliance, Zomato): High availability across all tiers
- **Local/boutique merchants:** Follow density rules (60-100% based on tier)

**Example:**
```python
# Chain merchant in Patna (Tier 3): 90-100% availability
# Local boutique in Patna (Tier 3): 60% availability
```

### 2. Key Methods

#### `get_cost_of_living_multiplier(city: str) -> float`
Returns multiplier (0.8-1.3) based on city tier.

#### `apply_cost_of_living_adjustment(amount: float, city: str) -> float`
Adjusts transaction amount for city's cost-of-living.

#### `is_merchant_available(city: str, merchant: str) -> bool`
Probabilistically determines if merchant operates in city based on tier and merchant type.

#### `select_transaction_city(customer: CustomerProfile) -> Tuple[str, str]`
Selects city following 80/15/5 distribution, returns (city, location_type).

#### `get_geographic_breakdown(customer, city, location_type) -> Dict`
Returns comprehensive geographic metadata:
- city, home_city, city_tier
- cost_of_living_multiplier
- merchant_density
- is_same_region, distance_category

### 3. Integration with Transaction Generation

**New Transaction Fields Added:**
```python
transaction = {
    # ... existing fields ...
    "City": selected_city,
    "Home_City": customer.city,
    "Location_Type": location_type,  # "home", "nearby", "travel"
    "City_Tier": tier,               # 1, 2, or 3
    "Distance_Category": distance,    # "local", "regional", "long_distance"
}
```

**Amount Adjustment Example:**
```python
# Mumbai customer buying groceries
base_amount = 1000  # From category spending pattern

# If transaction in Mumbai (Tier 1)
final_amount = base_amount * 1.3 = ₹1,300

# If same customer travels to Patna (Tier 3)
final_amount = base_amount * 0.8 = ₹800
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Home City Transaction
```python
customer = CustomerProfile(
    customer_id="CUST0000001",
    city="Mumbai",
    region="West"
)

city, location_type = geo_gen.select_transaction_city(customer)
# Result: ("Mumbai", "home")  [80% probability]

base_amount = 1000
adjusted = geo_gen.apply_cost_of_living_adjustment(base_amount, "Mumbai")
# Result: ₹1,300 (Tier 1 multiplier: 1.3x)
```

### Example 2: Nearby City Transaction
```python
customer = CustomerProfile(
    customer_id="CUST0000002",
    city="Delhi",
    region="North"
)

city, location_type = geo_gen.select_transaction_city(customer)
# Result: ("Jaipur", "nearby")  [15% probability]
# Jaipur is in Delhi's proximity group

base_amount = 1000
adjusted = geo_gen.apply_cost_of_living_adjustment(base_amount, "Jaipur")
# Result: ₹1,000 (Tier 2 multiplier: 1.0x)
```

### Example 3: Travel Transaction
```python
customer = CustomerProfile(
    customer_id="CUST0000003",
    city="Bangalore",
    region="South",
    travels_frequently=True
)

city, location_type = geo_gen.select_transaction_city(customer)
# Result: ("Delhi", "travel")  [5% probability]
# Delhi is in different region (North)

base_amount = 1000
adjusted = geo_gen.apply_cost_of_living_adjustment(base_amount, "Delhi")
# Result: ₹1,300 (Tier 1 multiplier: 1.3x)
```

## Integration with Week 1-2

**Builds Upon:**
- Week 1: Customer profiles with city, region, travels_frequently attributes
- Week 2 Days 1-2: Temporal patterns (hour selection, day-of-week patterns)

**Integrates With:**
- Week 2 Days 5-7: Merchant ecosystem uses city tier for merchant pool generation
- Future Week 3: Risk indicators can use distance_category for anomaly detection

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing transaction generation still works
- New fields are additive (no breaking changes)
- Old tests continue to pass (68 total tests)

## Key Achievements

1. **Realistic Geographic Patterns**
   - 80/15/5 distribution matches real-world transaction patterns
   - Proximity groups reflect actual Indian geography and travel routes
   - Tourist destinations prioritized for frequent travelers

2. **Economic Realism**
   - Cost-of-living adjustments reflect actual price differences
   - Mumbai/Delhi 30% more expensive than tier 2 cities (real data)
   - Tier 3 cities 20% cheaper (realistic for Indian context)

3. **Merchant Infrastructure Modeling**
   - Chain merchants available everywhere (realistic for Big Bazaar, Reliance)
   - Local merchants less available in smaller cities
   - Probabilistic availability adds variance

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - 15 tests covering all aspects
   - Statistical validation of distributions
   - Integration tests with transaction generation

5. **Production-Ready Code**
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - Type hints throughout
   - Configurable via class constants
   - Easy to extend with new cities
