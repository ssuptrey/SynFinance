# Week 2, Days 3-4 Summary: Geographic Patterns Implementation

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Test Results:** 15/15 tests passing (100%)

---

## Objective

Implement realistic geographic patterns for Indian financial transactions with city-tier classification, cost-of-living adjustments, and proximity-based transaction distribution.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. GeographicPatternGenerator Class
- 80/15/5 city distribution (home/nearby/distant)
- City tier classification (Tier 1: Metros, Tier 2: Major, Tier 3: Smaller)
- Cost-of-living multipliers (1.3x / 1.0x / 0.8x)
- Proximity groups for nearby cities
- Merchant density by tier (100% / 80% / 60%)

### 2. Key Features
- Home city dominance (80% of transactions)
- Nearby cities in same region or proximity group (15%)
- Travel/distant cities in different regions (5%)
- Price adjustments: Mumbai 30% higher, Patna 20% lower
- Chain merchants available everywhere, local merchants tier-dependent

### 3. City Tiers
- **Tier 1 (8 cities):** Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Ahmedabad
- **Tier 2 (7 cities):** Jaipur, Lucknow, Surat, Chandigarh, Indore, Kochi, Nagpur
- **Tier 3 (5 cities):** Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Patna, Vadodara, Coimbatore

### 4. Integration
- New transaction fields: City, Home_City, Location_Type, City_Tier, Distance_Category
- Amount adjustment based on transaction city's cost-of-living
- Merchant availability filtered by city tier

---

## Example
```python
customer = CustomerProfile(city="Mumbai", region="West")
city, location_type = geo_gen.select_transaction_city(customer)
# Result: ("Mumbai", "home") [80% probability]

adjusted_amount = geo_gen.apply_cost_of_living_adjustment(1000, "Mumbai")
# Result: â‚¹1,300 (Tier 1 metro: 30% higher)
```

---

## Test Coverage
- 15 tests for tier classification, COL adjustments, 80/15/5 distribution, merchant availability
- All tests passing

---

## Key Achievements
- Realistic geographic transaction patterns for Indian market
- Economic realism with city-based price differences
- Extensible proximity groups and tier system
- Foundation for merchant ecosystem and risk indicators
