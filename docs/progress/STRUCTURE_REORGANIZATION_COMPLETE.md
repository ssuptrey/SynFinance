## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 3 Day 2-3)
1. [DONE] Structure reorganization COMPLETE
2. [IN PROGRESS] Create test_advanced_schema.py (15+ tests)
3. [TODO] Perform correlation analysis (20+ correlations)
4. [TODO] Update user documentation (INTEGRATION_GUIDE, QUICK_REFERENCE)

### Short-term (Week 3 Day 4-7)
- Performance benchmarking
- Complete Week 3 documentation
- Prepare for Week 4 (fraud detection)

### Long-term (Weeks 4-12)
- Maintain structure discipline
- Update docs as features added
- Keep root folder clean
- Archive outdated docs regularly

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Organization Matters
A well-organized project is easier to:
- Navigate
- Contribute to
- Maintain
- Launch commercially

### 2. Documentation is Critical
Good documentation includes:
- User guides (how to use)
- Developer guides (how to contribute)
- Technical docs (how it works)
- Progress tracking (what's done)

### 3. Professional Presentation
First impressions matter:
- Clean root folder
- Professional README
- Clear license
- Contribution guidelines

### 4. Balance Structure vs Simplicity
- Not too deep (avoid src/core/main/generators/...)
- Not too flat (avoid 50 files in root)
- Logical grouping (examples/ scripts/ docs/)
- Clear purposes (each folder has a README)
