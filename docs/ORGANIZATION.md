# SynFinance Documentation Organization

**Complete Guide to Documentation Structure**

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025  
**Version:** 0.4.0  
**Action:** Documentation reorganized into week-based and topic-based folders

---

## Overview

The documentation has been reorganized for better scalability and maintainability:
- Progress reports organized by week (week1/, week2/, week3/, week4/)
- Technical documentation organized by topic (fraud/, schemas/)
- Index files added for easy navigation
- Clear separation between user guides, technical specs, and progress reports

---

## Documentation Structure Explained

### docs/planning/ - Strategic Documents
**Purpose:** High-level business and strategic planning  
**Who needs this:** Founders, decision-makers, investors, business analysts  
**Contains:**
- Assessment of current state and future potential
- Business strategy and financial projections
- Development roadmap and milestones

**Why separate:** Business decisions require different documentation than implementation

---

### docs/guides/ - Implementation Guides
**Purpose:** Step-by-step how-to guides for developers  
**Who needs this:** Developers, implementers, contributors  
**Contains:**
- Quick start instructions
- Week-by-week implementation details
- Code examples and walkthroughs
- Best practices

**Why separate:** Action-oriented guides need quick access without business context

---

### docs/technical/ - Technical Reference
**Purpose:** Design specs, technical standards, and detailed documentation  
**Who needs this:** Developers, designers, data scientists  
**Contains:**
- Design system and UI guidelines
- Change logs and version history
- Schema documentation
- Progress reports and validation results

**Why separate:** Technical reference material distinct from implementation guides

---

## Source Code Organization

### src/ - All Application Code
**Why this structure:**
- Standard Python package layout
- Clean imports: `from src.customer_profile import CustomerProfile`
- Separates code from configuration and documentation
- Easy to test and maintain
- Scalable as project grows

**Package Contents:**
```python
src/
|-- __init__.py              # Package initialization (version info)
|-- app.py                   # Main Streamlit application
|-- config.py                # Configuration constants
|-- data_generator.py        # Transaction generation
|-- customer_profile.py      # Customer schema definitions
|-- customer_generator.py    # Customer generation logic
```

---

## Tests Organization

### tests/ - All Test Files
**Why separate:**
- Standard Python testing convention
- Easy to run all tests: `pytest tests/`
- Clear distinction from source code
- Can grow as project adds features

**Current Tests:**
- test_customer_generation.py - Comprehensive customer validation

**Future Tests:**
- test_transaction_generation.py
- test_fraud_detection.py
- test_data_quality.py
- test_api_endpoints.py

---

## Output Organization

### output/ - Generated Files
**Purpose:** Store all generated datasets and reports  
**Why separate:**
- Keeps generated files out of source control
- Clear location for exports
- Easy to clean up
- Standard for data projects

**Contains:**
- customer_validation_stats.json - Validation statistics
- Generated CSV/Excel transaction files
- Quality reports
- ML training datasets (future)

---

## data/ - Sample Data
**Purpose:** Store sample datasets, test data, reference files  
**Why separate:**
- Version control for reference data
- Separate from generated output
- Easy to distribute with project
- Standard data science convention

**Current Status:** Empty (reserved for future use)
