## Recent Updates

### Week 6 Complete - Performance & Production Deployment (December 2025)  NEW

**Performance Optimization (Days 1-2):**
- Implemented parallel generation (45K+ txn/sec using multiprocessing)
- Created streaming generator for memory-efficient processing
- Built LRU caching system (3-5x speedup for repeated operations)
- Added performance benchmarking tools and scaling tests
- Validated with 500K+ transaction datasets

**Advanced Analytics & Model Optimization (Days 3-4):**
- Implemented correlation analysis (Pearson/Spearman with visualization)
- Created feature importance analyzer (permutation, tree-based, MI)
- Built model performance analyzer with comprehensive metrics
- Added statistical test framework (chi-square, t-test, ANOVA)
- Created interactive HTML dashboard generator
- Implemented hyperparameter optimization (grid search, random search)
- Built ensemble model system (voting, stacking, bagging)
- Created feature selection tools (RFE, Lasso, correlation-based)
- Added model registry with versioning and comparison

**Production Infrastructure (Days 5-7):**
- Created Docker multi-stage builds (dev 1.2GB, prod 800MB)
- Built Docker Compose orchestration (API + monitoring stack)
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Created FastAPI server with < 100ms latency
- Added Kubernetes deployment manifests with HPA
- Built real-time monitoring dashboard with fraud alerting
- Created comprehensive integration examples (4 scripts, 2,230 lines)
- Wrote enterprise deployment guide (1,100 lines covering 12 major topics)

**Files Created:**
- examples/complete_ml_pipeline.py (850 lines) - End-to-end workflow
- examples/api_integration_example.py (380 lines) - API usage patterns
- examples/batch_processing_example.py (430 lines) - Batch processing
- examples/real_time_monitoring.py (570 lines) - Live monitoring dashboard
- docs/technical/deployment/PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md (1,100 lines) - Enterprise deployment
- src/performance/* (8 files, 2,000+ lines) - Performance modules
- src/analytics/* (4 files, 2,500+ lines) - Analytics modules
- src/ml/model_optimization.py (900+ lines) - Model optimization
- src/api/* (3 files, 800+ lines) - FastAPI implementation
- tests/performance/, tests/analytics/, tests/api/ (100+ tests)
- Dockerfile, Dockerfile.dev, docker-compose.yml, .dockerignore
- .github/workflows/* (3 CI/CD workflows)
- deploy/kubernetes/* (5 K8s manifests)

**Test Results:**
- **498 tests passing (100%)**
- All core functionality validated
- Docker tests skipped (expected without Docker installed)
- Performance benchmarks exceed targets (45K+ txn/sec)

See [WEEK6_DAY7_COMPLETE.md](docs/progress/week6/WEEK6_DAY7_COMPLETE.md) for detailed summary.

### Week 3 Days 2-3 Complete (October 21, 2025)

**Testing & Correlation Analysis:**
- Created test_advanced_schema.py (30 tests, 22/30 passing - 73%)
- Generated 10,000 transaction dataset with 45 fields
- Calculated 9x9 correlation matrix (2 strong correlations found)
- Analyzed 5 key patterns with statistical validation:
  - Age vs Payment Mode (Young prefer digital, seniors prefer debit)
  - Income vs Amount (ANOVA F=45.93, p<0.0001 - Premium spends 4.8x more)
  - Digital Savviness vs Device (High=49.7% Mobile, Low=74.7% POS)
  - Distance vs Status (r=0.350 with new merchant flag)
  - Time vs Channel (Mobile peaks evening, POS peaks business hours)
- Generated correlation heatmap and pattern visualizations
- Created comprehensive analysis documentation (18KB report)

**Files Created:**
- tests/generators/test_advanced_schema.py (850 lines, 30 tests)
- scripts/generate_week3_dataset.py (146 lines)
- scripts/analyze_correlations.py (284 lines)
- docs/progress/WEEK3_DAY2-3_ANALYSIS.md (18KB comprehensive report)
- docs/progress/WEEK3_DAY2-3_COMPLETE.md (completion checklist)
- docs/progress/WEEK3_DAY2_IMPORT_FIX_SUMMARY.md (import error resolution)

### Modular Refactoring (October 17, 2025)

**Why:** Original `data_generator.py` (889 lines) would become unmaintainable with Week 2-12 features

**What Changed:**
- [OK] Extracted Indian market data → `utils/indian_data.py` (107 lines)
- [OK] Moved core logic → `generators/transaction_core.py` (608 lines)  
- [OK] Created clean API → `data_generator.py` (235 lines)
- [OK] 73% reduction in main file size
- [OK] Performance improved: 25,739 txn/sec (up from 17,858)
- [OK] All 19/19 tests still passing (100%)
- [OK] Backward compatible (old imports still work)

**Benefits:**
- Easy to extend for Week 2-12 features
- Better testing and maintainability
- Clean separation of concerns
- Ready for production

See [REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md](REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md) for full details.
